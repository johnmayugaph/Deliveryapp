## Note on phase numbering

The brief that produced this commit described itself as **superseding Phase 4
onward** of an existing plan, and asked for its changes to be folded into the
schema **before Phase 2 ran**.

When the brief arrived this repository had **zero commits** — no plan, no
schema, no `docs/`, nothing to supersede or amend. So rather than write a
Phase 4 and immediately replace it, the phases below are renumbered around what
actually happened:

- The brief's eight decisions are the **foundation**, not a revision to one.
- Because Phase 2 (schema migration) had not run, the changes are in the
  **initial migration** — `20260906134534_unified_multi_service_schema` — rather
  than a follow-up. That is exactly what "fold into the schema before Phase 2
  runs" asked for, and it means there is no legacy `RiderProfile` table, no
  food-only `Order`, and no migration to walk back.
- Phases 0–4 below are complete in this commit. Phases 5+ are the road ahead
  and replace whatever the original Phase 4 onward would have been.

If a plan document turns up elsewhere and its numbering matters, the mapping is:
this commit delivers everything the old plan's Phases 1–3 would have, with the
brief's changes already folded in.

## Phase 0 — Foundation ✅

Next.js App Router + React + TypeScript, Prisma against PostgreSQL, Tailwind,
Vitest. Strict TypeScript including `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`.

ESLint carries a `no-restricted-syntax` rule rejecting any comparison against a
service-key literal, so the registry rule is caught at edit time rather than in
review.

## Phase 1 — Domain model ✅

All eight decisions from the brief, in full. See
[architecture.md](./architecture.md) for the reasoning behind each; the headline
choices:

- **Service registry.** Five `Service` rows; `FOOD` active, four
  `isComingSoon`. No hardcoded service list and no service-key branch anywhere,
  enforced by a grep test and by ESLint.
- **Unified order.** One `Order` table, shared columns real, vertical-specific
  fields in a validated `details` JSON container. Only the FOOD shape is
  implemented; the other four are written down and fail loudly.
- **Status handling.** One superset enum; allowed transitions defined **per
  service** in `ORDER_LIFECYCLES`. PARCEL skips merchant acceptance entirely.
  The state machine reads the map and contains no service-key literal.
- **Unified identity.** One `User` per person, `roles` as an **array**. One
  address book with `usageCount`, `lastUsedAt` and `isPickupCapable`.
- **Unified fleet.** `RiderProfile` → **`FleetPartner`**, with
  `enabledServices`, `vehicleType`, and per-service verification. Dispatch reads
  `enabledServices`; ranking logic unchanged.
- **Credits.** Ledger-only. No top-up, no transfers, no cash-out, spendable on
  orders only — enforced in code, in tests, and by SQL triggers and CHECK
  constraints. Balance derived from the ledger, never written directly.
- **Subscription.** Structured benefit records the pricing engine reads. One
  seeded plan, **inactive**.
- **Unified support.** One `SupportTicket` across all verticals; help section
  driven by the registry.

### Decisions worth remembering

- **Money is integer centavos everywhere.** Percentages are basis points, so
  7.5% needs no migration.
- **Address snapshots are denormalised onto orders.** An order must stay
  readable after the source address changes or is deleted.
- **`requiresMerchant` ≠ merchant acceptance.** The first is "must reference a
  store" (FOOD, MART); the second is a lifecycle step that only FOOD has.
  Conflating them is how the `if FOOD` branches come back.
- **`Service.intentGroup` owns grouping; the label file owns names.**
  `intent-groups.ts` contains no service keys, so regrouping the home screen is
  a data edit. Group names are Filipino-market: *Pagkain at Grocery*, *Padala at
  Pabili*, *Sakay*, *Bayad*.
- **`SupportTicket.serviceType` is nullable.** A literal reading of the brief
  would make it required, but an account-level problem belongs to no vertical
  and forcing one would make the data lie.
- **Free delivery does not zero the fee.** The fee stays at full value and the
  waiver is a discount line, so the receipt shows the customer what the tier
  bought them — and so the amount is not subtracted twice. (It was, briefly;
  the tests caught it.)
- **Credit-back is not a discount.** The customer pays full price and the
  credits arrive on completion, through the ledger.
- **Quoting writes nothing.** Benefit usage is committed only once the order
  exists, so an abandoned checkout cannot burn a monthly allowance.

## Phase 2 — Schema and data ✅

- `prisma/schema.prisma`: 23 models, 16 enums.
- Initial migration `20260906134534_unified_multi_service_schema`.
- `prisma/sql/wallet_append_only.sql`: append-only triggers on the credits
  ledger plus five CHECK constraints. Applied by `npm run prisma:guards`.
- `prisma/seed.ts`: 5 cities, 5 services (FOOD active in 3 cities), 3 stores
  with menus, 3 FAQ categories, 1 inactive subscription plan with 3 structured
  benefits, 2 promotions, 2 users — one of whom holds both `CUSTOMER` and
  `FLEET_PARTNER` on a single record, approved for FOOD and pending for RIDE.

`prisma/seed.ts` is the **only** file in the codebase that enumerates the five
services. That is the point of the registry.

## Phase 3 — Core backend ✅

| Module | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `lib/services/registry.ts` | The only reader of the registry |
| `lib/orders/transitions.ts` | Per-service lifecycle config map |
| `lib/orders/state-machine.ts` | Reads the map; atomic, audited, concurrency-guarded |
| `lib/orders/details.ts` | Per-service details shapes; FOOD implemented |
| `lib/wallet/rules.ts` | Pure ledger rules — sign derivation, replay |
| `lib/wallet/ledger.ts` | The single mutation entry point |
| `lib/pricing/benefits.ts` | Pure benefit arithmetic |
| `lib/pricing/checkout.ts` | Registry + subscription + credits orchestration |
| `lib/fleet/dispatch.ts` | Candidates filtered by `enabledServices` |
| `lib/addresses/usage.ts` | Shared address book and order snapshots |
| `lib/support/tickets.ts` | Unified tickets and registry-driven FAQ |

## Phase 4 — Customer app shell ✅

Home (`/`) rebuilt around service selection: location with tap-to-change,
cross-service search, intent-grouped registry-driven tiles with dimmed
non-tappable coming-soon states, active-order strip across all verticals,
promotions, recent stores.

Bottom navigation Home / Orders / Credits / Profile. `/orders` is one
chronological list across every service. Also `/credits` (with the four
constraints stated in plain Filipino), `/profile` (roles from the array, fleet
approvals per service), `/help`, `/search`, `/addresses`, `/services/[key]`,
`/orders/[orderId]`, `/stores/[slug]`.

### Verification

- `npm run verify` — **62 tests**, all passing, no database needed.
- Verified against live PostgreSQL 16 with the SQL guards applied — **42
  end-to-end checks**, all passing.
- `npm run build` and `npm run lint` clean; every route returns 200 against
  seeded data.

---

## Phase 5 — FOOD checkout end to end ⬜ Next

The first real order. Everything it needs exists; this is wiring, not design.

- Cart state and a store/menu ordering screen.
- Address selection from the shared book, snapshotted onto the order via
  `toOrderAddressSnapshot()`; `bumpAddressUsage()` on placement.
- Delivery-fee calculation by distance, feeding `quoteOrderPrice()`.
- Order creation → `parseOrderDetails(FOOD, …)` → `submitOrder()` →
  `commitBenefitUsage()` → `spendOnOrder()`, all in one transaction.
- Merchant-acceptance timeout moving orders to `CANCELLED_BY_SYSTEM` with a
  `refundToCredits()` entry.
- Grant `CREDIT_BACK_PERCENT` accruals on `COMPLETED`.
- Live tracking on `/orders/[orderId]`.

## Phase 6 — Authentication ⬜

`src/lib/auth/session.ts` is a **placeholder** resolving the seeded demo
customer. Replace with OTP over SMS against `User.phone`. Keep the two
properties that matter: it returns **one** `User`, and roles are read from
`user.roles` — nothing may assume a session belongs to a customer.

Order tracking is already scoped to the signed-in customer; an order id is not
an access token.

## Phase 7 — Fleet partner app ⬜

Onboarding that submits per-service verification documents; offer/accept using
`findDispatchCandidates()`; status updates through the state machine with
`OrderActor.FLEET_PARTNER`; location updates; earnings.

A partner may hold approvals for several verticals and should see the union of
what they are approved for — never a food-shaped UI with the others bolted on.

## Phase 8 — Merchant tools ⬜

Accept/reject queue, prep-time management, menu and availability editing, and a
merchant-facing order history. Reads `Store.serviceKeys`, so the same tools
serve a MART store later.

## Phase 9 — Subscription launch decision ⬜ Gated

The plan is seeded and inactive. Before flipping `isActive`, decide from data:

- Would free delivery over ₱299 (8×/month) pay for itself at current fees?
- Is the 2% credit-back ceiling of ₱200/month the right exposure?
- Does ₱99/month clear the average monthly delivery-fee spend of the customers
  most likely to subscribe?

Flipping `isActive` is the entire launch mechanism — the pricing engine picks it
up with no deploy. Which also means it should not be flipped casually.

## Phase 10 — Second vertical ⬜ Gated on demand

Which of MART, PARCEL, PABILI or RIDE goes second should come from the
coming-soon tiles, not from a hunch. Instrument taps on dimmed tiles first;
that is the measurement those records exist for.

Activating one is:

1. Implement its `details` shape in `ORDER_DETAILS_SPECS` (the placeholder is
   already written down).
2. Review its lifecycle in `ORDER_LIFECYCLES` (already drafted).
3. Build its ordering flow.
4. Approve fleet partners for it via per-service verification.
5. Set `isActive: true` and populate `availableCityIds`.

Steps 1 and 3 are the real work. The home screen, order history, search, help,
credits, subscription benefits, dispatch and support need **no changes** — that
is the return on this phase's design, and the thing to protect in review.

---

## Known gaps

- **No authentication.** `getCurrentUser()` returns the seeded demo customer.
- **No checkout.** Order creation is exercised by tests and the end-to-end
  verification, not by a UI.
- **Icons are emoji.** `serviceGlyph()` is a lookup, so swapping in a real icon
  set touches one map.
- **No realtime.** Tracking renders the `OrderStatusEvent` trail on load; there
  is no push yet.
- **Fee calculation is a caller input.** `quoteOrderPrice()` takes
  `baseDeliveryFeeCentavos`; distance-based pricing is Phase 5.
- **`prisma/sql` guards need `psql`** on the deploy host, and must be applied
  after every `migrate deploy` (`npm run db:setup` does both).
